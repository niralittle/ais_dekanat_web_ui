A student project.

A university consists of multiple departments (aka faculties), and operating each one takes quite some time and effort. 
This project is aimed at automating some of the typical tasks on faculty management, such as:
- maintaining respective info:
  - cathedra lists
      - cathedra's tutors, lecturers, etc
      - cathedra's overall info (histoty, manager's names, etc)
  - student lists
    - courses (where a course is a tuple <year of study; major>) and groups (where a group is a subset of students that belong to a certain course)
    - each groups class schedule (tuples like <group; class name; lecturer>)
  - session exam data
    - schedule (group; class; exam supervisor; time/date; room)
    - exam results
  - statistics
    - passing student rates
    - average grade
    - etc
